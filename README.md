# EmojiMatch
## Description
EmojiMatch is a basic machine learning recommendation system that suggests emojis based on a typed in message. Using K-Means and Support Vector Machines, EmojiMatch attempts to match your message's polarity (positivity and negativity) and subjectivity (how subejctive or objective your message is) to that of 4 basic emojis.
